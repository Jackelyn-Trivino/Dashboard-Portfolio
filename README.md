# Dashboard-Portfolio
Welcome to my Power BI Dashboard Portfolio. This repository highlights a selection of my dashboard projects, designed to deliver clear, actionable insights for business stakeholders across multiple industries. Each Dashboard was built with usability, performance, and visual storytelling in mind.
## About Me
I am passionate about all things Data. Having studied Information Technology with a concentration in Database Management, all things Data has been my life's work for the past 9 years. Starting out as a Database Administrator, I transitioned to become a Data Analyst to allow me to be more creative with the data I was handling. I have experience designing and maintaining interactive dashboards that drive decision-making. My work emphasizes clean design, intuitive user experience, and leveraging DAX and Power Query for powerful data modeling.

### 1. Example Dashboard - Overview Page
**Purpose:** This dashboard is an example of an Overview Page I created for a client. It was designed to help the HR Department with their Hiring Process.

**Key Features** 
- It uses KPI Callout Boxes to show users important metrics in a clear view. It incorporates DAX to show current KPI performance as well as a Prior Year comparison under the current value. The "See Details" button navigates users to a more Detailed Page pertaining to that specific KPI measure
- The page also contains several visuals to better understand the Hiring Process and all its components such as a Funnel Chart, a trended line chart analysis, and a comparison bar chart
- This page contains an interactive aspect in which users can switch what data they're viewing by using the toggle component in the middle of the page
- This page was designed and created entirely from scratch in which I designed and created all the DAX utilized in the dashboard.

**Tools Used** 
Power BI, DAX, Power Query

**Business Impact**
The business was able to use and leverage the information provided in the dashboard to better see how their hiring process was structured, areas of impovement, and future steps which was vital to their growing business.

**Confidentiality**
Real Data and any identifying features were removed for Confidentiality of the Client's business.
